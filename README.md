# Adventure Game
This is a little game I wrote up for my brother's birthday. 
It was kinda rushed and I didn't know anything about frontend development at the time so 
there's a lot of room for improvement but it was a lot of fun to build!

If anyone comes across this and is interested to talk about it just open up an issue :)

## Source?

As you can see in the Rakefile the site is published here by blowing away the previous stuff instead of having a history. I actually don't remember why I did it this way at the moment. I think it was to compile the assets so that my brother couldn't just look up the solutions by reading the source...
